> This GUI desktop editor app was developed during an earlier development iteration

> However since adapting the editor code to the latest meta-model structures should be quite easy,
> the complete code base was published nevertheless. It probably will be fixed / adapted at some point in time,

**Possible TODOs**

- Console outputs for the following events
    - Attribute type has been changed
    - Default value of attribute has been changed
- Possible exceptions that could occur
- Not all properties are selectable for communication objects
- Hide dropdown if empty
- Different zoom levels for the EditorPane
- Always display attributes in the same order
- Rename elements that have already been created
